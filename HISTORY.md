- Increased the max retires when downloading the permit PDF from 10 to 30. (One of my tickets took 6 retires to download...)

## v1.0.0

With this initial release, you should be able to sign in with your Select-a-Spot account, pick "daily" permit, choose your station, which day and vehicle you need the permit for and eventually confirm and make the purchase. In the end the tool will also download the permit PDF for you to print.
